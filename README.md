 A Java-based application leveraging Azure cloud services, utilizing REST APIs for communication and microservice architecture.
 
#Project Overview
This project is designed to provide a scalable, reliable, and high-performance platform using Java and Azure. The application is built using a distributed microservice architecture, with REST APIs facilitating communication between services. It integrates with various Azure cloud services to ensure robustness and flexibility.

Features
RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
Microservice architecture
Integration with Azure services (e.g., Azure App Service, Azure SQL, Azure Kubernetes Service)
Automated CI/CD pipeline
Containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes
Secure and scalable cloud infrastructure
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language
Spring Boot: Framework for building REST APIs and microservices
Spring Data JPA: Data access and persistence layer
Spring Security: Authentication and authorization
Azure Cloud Services: Hosting, databases, and other cloud services
PostgreSQL: Database for persistent storage
Docker: Containerization of the application
Kubernetes: Orchestration of containerized applications
Maven: Build automation tool
Git: Version control system
Architecture
The project follows a microservice architecture, with each service encapsulating specific business logic and exposing RESTful APIs. Azure services are used for hosting, data storage, and monitoring.
